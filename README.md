# Machine Learning scripts

This repository aims to fix some issues concerning repetitiveness in machine learning workflows. This repository contains small to medium sized Python code snippets that automate:
1. Dependency/module importing
2. Dataset loading
3. Dataset preprocessing
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Model visualization using Scikit-Learn's visualization API

The purpose was to automate the repetitive parts. This repository is actively being developed and improved and if you happen to stumble upon this repo, feel free to fork it.
